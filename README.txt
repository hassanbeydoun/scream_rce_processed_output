There are 11 npz files in this folder each containing data from one of the simulations. The file name includes which SST the data in that file corresponds to. Within the dataset, numpy arrays have dimensions (Time,Height). All data in this paper except for the analysis in the SI only use the second height level (i.e., Height=1).
